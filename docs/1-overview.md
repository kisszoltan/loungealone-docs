## What can I do on Lounge Alone?

Ask question from influencers who will most probably answer it. Or in case you are influencer answer questions of your followers and earn money.

If you are a follower of influencers or just interested in topics or niches of certain influencers you can ask them questions directly. Usually influencers with large follower base do not have the time and capacity to answer every question of their followers on the regular platforms because of the volume of questions.
