# Platform Fees

The platform is free to use for both influencers and followers although there is 10% platform fee when buying credits.

## What is free, what is paid on this site?

Anonymous users can list lounges, read their questions and responses but nothing else. Users must register and login to setup their own lounge and share it with other users. Setting up payments and pricing on the user's profile is the only condition to enable questions on the lounge so influencers can start hosting their lounges for free.

To ask questions users must buy credits where 10% platform fee is applied. The price of 10 credits is set by the lounge owner individually, so its is up to the influencers how high the price is.

Answering questions is also free of charge, however if the quality of the answer is rated low, the user who raised the question receive back some credits.
