# Credits

Crediting system on Lounge Aloune is unique and extraordinary to satisfy both those who raise the question and those who answer.

---

## What are credits?

Credits are internal coins used on Lounge Alone to pay for asking a question and receiving answer for it.

Every question raised on Lounge Alone is rated/evaluated by artificial intelligence (AI) on a 1 to 5 scale. Many factors are considered like 'Language Quality', 'Relevance', 'Usefulness','Engagement Potential' and 'Originality' but in general we can say if you do your best to ask the right question from your beloved influencer who you know, your question will be rated 5. The higher the question rate, the less credit it costs for the user who asked it.

When an influencer answers a question a similar evaluation process is applied but in this case, the higher the value the more credit it costs.

## How much does one credit cost?

Every lounge owner can individually set (and change anytime) the price of 10 credits for their own lounge. The minimum price is $10 while the maximum is $9999999 (which is infinity in practice).

## How much does it cost to ask one question?

If you ask a question rated 1, but the lounge host gives the best answer ever, then it costs 10 credits. So maximum 5 credits for the question, and 5 credits for the answer. When raising the question the exact price of the question is substracted from your credit balance, in additionally to 5 credits which is substracted in advance for the answer. If the answer turns out to cost less than 5 credits then the difference is sent back to your balance.

One question-answer pair can cost maximum 10 credits, but if you ask great questions, or the answer what you received is not the best, then you will have extra credits for your next question(s). Consider this as a compensation for an incomplete answer or reward for a good question.

## Can I sell credits or use in different lounges?

No and no. Credits cannot be refunded or reused in other lounges so be careful when buying them.
