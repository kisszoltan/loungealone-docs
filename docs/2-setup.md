# Setup your profile

Setting details for your profile on the platform is not mandatory as authentication providers (like Google and X) provides neccessary information already for default values. There are however a few fields which might be needed to set/change to use all features of the platform.

---

## What is mandatory?

By default everything is set so nothing is mandatory to define in addition to use the site as a "follower". This means you will be able to access every user's lounge and buy credit and ask questions.

{: .warning .fs-3 }

Default user profiles are not listed on lounge browser page, and users cannot buy credits or ask questions from users with default profile. To enable "influencer" features (like listing on lounge browser page, and enable questioning feature) [setup your Payments information](#payments).

## User information

Authentication providers are forwarding user's already set email address and display name which are listed on the settings page. Email address is read-only at the moment and the platform does not do anything with it expcet storing. Display name can be changed anytime, to anything. Yes, really! And it does not have to be unique either. We don't care if you wish to put only one single character as display name. It is in your interest to render yourself as noticable and obvious as possible.

Name is only for informing users about yourself, nothing else. Bio on the other hand has more connection to the platforms behaviour. Additionally to the information what it carries for the users, it is also used to evaluate question quality. So define your bio as close to your niche as possible, and only questions related to your domain will be rated high.

## Social Media Profiles

In early stages social media profiles are not possible to link to your profile. It only show your X (Twitter) profile if you have registered/logged is through your X (Twitter) account.

## Payments

### PayPal

To enable other users to raise question in your lounge you have to connect your PayPal account and define price for your credits.

PayPal account can simply be linked to your profile by clicking the "Connect your PayPal account" button on your settings page and follow the instructions from PayPal on the screen.

{: .warning .fs-3 }
In Beta Testing Phase connecting PayPal is only available for selected users, so contact developers for permission.

{: .highlight .fs-3 }
Connecting your PayPal account does not cost anything, no transactions are initiated during the process.

When successfully connected, your PayPal email address will be show next to the button. Your email address is kept by the system only, it is not visible for other users.

To disconnect your PayPal account go to PayPal.com, and after login remove our application on the [PayPal settings page](https://www.paypal.com/businessmanage/account/accountAccess/unifiedsettings/loginWithPaypal).

### Price

Another mandatory field to set so that your followers can raise questions in your lounge is the price field.

A "most expensive question/answer pair" will cost 10 credits for the user who asks it, so on this page you have to define the price for one "most expensive question/answer pair". So setting $10 (which is the minimum value by the way) will mean to cost $10 for the users to buy 10 credits to your lounge.

{: .warning .fs-3 }
Also consider that there is 10% platform fee in place, so setting $10 will mean you to receive $9 after each 10 credits sold for your lounge.
