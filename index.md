> Lounge Alone is in beta test phase therefore changes in features and their documentation might occur without notice.

Do you follow interesting persons to learn something from them? Have you ever wondered what would you ask if you could talk directly to them? [LoungeAlone] is a platform where influencers allow their followers to raise questions and they answer it. Why would they do that on this platform rather than do it on other platforms where they already live? Because [LoungeAlone] offers them to provide their time as a paid service.

Influencers with large follower base are overwhelmed by questions from their followers. [LoungeAlone] helps them to prioritize questions and also forces them to give accurate answers.

Join the platform and make those one-to-one questions worth it.

## Getting started

To join [LoungeAlone] users can use their Google or X (Twitter) accounts. Simply go to the [SignIn] page and follow the 3rd party provider's instructions.

{: .note }
Further authentication providers are in scope so stay tuned if you miss your favorite provider from the list.

Both login and registration is done in the same page so no further actions are required for registration. If you see your avatar on the top right corner, then you are in. In case you want to provide hosting services (aka you are an influencer and expect your followers to ask from you), then go to your settings page and [setup price and payment information](/setup.html). In other case just start browsing the lounges on [Lounge list](https://loungealone.netlify.app/lounge/list) page, or pick a direct link to a lounge from your influcencer.
